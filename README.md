# Real-Ransomware

A malware created with python, do not use it on your own computer, I recommend virtualbox only.
Feel free to upgrade the code or learn something new from it.
How does it work?
It will encrypt all the important files like .exe, .txt, .docx, .bin, .rtf, etc..
It will check for existing drives like C:/, D:/ ..
It will start walking through directories and it will filter files with the extensions I want to encrypt.
With the generated key you can decrypt all the files by using 'decryptor.py'.

DO NOT USE ON ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY!
